All of these articles I researched deal in depth with growth mindset, an important concept vital for achieving success in programing, school and life. The first article, How Teachers Can Create A Growth Mindset in the Classroom, by John Fensterwald examines different factors that contribute to children learning effectively. Additionally, throughout the article different educational leaders clarify common misconceptions about growth mindset. I strongly agree with the ideas presented in the article, specifically about how “telling [students] they would have done better if they had tried harder, isn’t enough,” because often students will have put their best effort forward, but their assessments scores will not reflect that. Likewise, the study done which showed that the praises which children receive at young ages had an impact on their future development made me more cognizant about the way I reward the kids I tutor. Secondly, Allison Kaptur’s article dealt with the results of the now infamous study by Carol Dweck about growth mindset. I found almost every piece of information in this article informative and found all the results completely applicable to my real life. For example, one subject I’ve always had trouble in has been Science—I never particularly liked the subject, and as a result I never put much effort into it because I always believed that I was never good at it. After reading this article, it is obvious that the reason I sometimes lack success in science is because of my fixed mindset. Now, I can see myself trying to incorporating growth mindset into aspects of my life that I feel insecure or unsure about because of the positive results that come with this change in attitude. The final article, Fixed vs. Growth, goes through a more in depth study on how growth mindset affects different people’s personalities and character traits. I found this article very engaging because lots of the people who participated in case studies and were written about by the author were very similar to people I know in real life. For example, the students who lied about their test scores because they felt as though it made them seem less smart to others are students that I frequently interact with at Latin. Reading about the differences in behavior between those with growth mindset and a fixed mindset gave me an illuminated some of my own behavior and me peers’. In the future I hope to incorporate many of the traits that Carol Deewy equates with growth mindset into my own life, specifically: having a more positive outlook and developing more reliance. Overall, these different studies clearly indicate that a major factor in leading a fulfilling life is how you approach various problems—for success, having a positive outlook is vital, and something I will work towards incorporating into my daily life.
